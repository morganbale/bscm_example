This test BSCM code from Kim et al (2020) with synthetic data and two different code parameterizations. The first is the "paper" example stan file which write the stan model to match the equations given in the paper. The second is the "code" example stan file that uses the stan model provided in Kim et al (2020)'s web appendix. 

After testing the models with synthetic data, I use Abadie et al (2010) smoking data set (proposition 99) with the BSCM code from Kim et al (2020)'s web appendix. The file recreates plots and tables from Abadie et al (2010) paper using BSCM instead of standard synthetic control. 

The slides provided give an overview of Synthetic control and Bayesian Synthetic Control.
